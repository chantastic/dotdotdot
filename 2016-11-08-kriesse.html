    Kristina,

  <p>
    First, thanks for the reply and engaging my angry; I think you're great.
  </p>

    It sounds like we both want to help empower newcomers.
    I've only instructed React newcomers.
    So, my viewpoint is informed by those starting their career in React.

    We have new JavaScript developers learning programming through the lens of components.
    Be it React, Angular, Ember, or Web Components, some new devs are learing UI development component-first.
    This is interesting.
    For as long as I've worked on the web we've attempted to emulate components by strategically stringing HTML, JS, and CSS together.
  </p>
  <p>
    React developers don't touch HTML.<br />
    React Native developers don't touch HTML or CSS.<br />
    <strong>They only touch components.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    For these new React Native developers, there is no cascade, no global styling scope, no specificity.
    It's just CSS declarations, right on a component.
  <p>
  </p>
    <strong>Wasn't this kind what we were after all along?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not a "CSS is dead" crier.
    I write A LOT of CSS.
    It doesn't have to "die" for CSS-in-JS to be valueable.
    Neither does it have to be universally adopted to be helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a new class of JavaScript devs with no need for traditional CSS.
  <p>
    I stand by that.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also stand by traditional developers.
    I don't think they need to be burdoned by exploratory JS toolsets.
  </p>
  </p>

    The concept of "beginner" is becoming relative.
    There isn't just one entry point to frontend development.
    My concern is that we look aronud at what's happening and say "Hey you, you have to jump through the hoops as I did to be a 'real' developer."
    I don't agree with that.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you can ship, you're a "real" dev.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's my part.
    I'd love to hear what your position is on us crazy JAVASCRIPT-ALL-THE-THINGS folks :)
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks again!
